                <h2>TERMS OF SERVICE</h2>
                <p><b>By paying for a commission you are agreeing to my TOS, whether you have read it or not.</b></p>
                <p class="color--haze">Last updated April 3rd, 2023.</p>
            </div>

            <p>- <b>I reserve the right to deny your request for a commission for any reason.</b> We may discuss pricing
                and
                alternatives but I will not haggle, if you do not value my time and work then I will not work with you.
            </p>
            <p>- Please provide up to 48 hours for me to contact you regarding a commission order.</p>
            <p>- Provide clear and detailed references and/or descriptions for your commission so that I can depict your
                character as accurately as possible. Please keep all references available until your commission is
                completed. Aspects of your character may be interpreted in a way that complements my art.</p>
            <p>- <b>I will edit commissions at completion if requested, but I will not redo them in full.</b> If you
                want to change the character/s, you must do so before I make progress beyond the sketch. </p>
            <p>- Edits that are an error on my part (misrepresented markings, colors, etc.) will be made free-of-charge;
                however any edits that are made after parts of the commission have already been approved may be subject
                to additional fees.</p>
            <p>- I will send sketches for most of my commissions to confirm composition and accurate portrayal of the
                subject before I start painting. If you do not give me your confirmation, no work will be done on your
                commission. This is also the best time to request changes. My workflow usually consists of discussion
                between us, a sketch (or sketches, in the case of larger commissions) that will be sent for confirmation
                or edits, then I work on the piece until completion. I occasionally will send updates, but you may also
                request updates from me.</p>
            <p>- I will not draw NSFW content for persons under 18 and will require proof of age. Overly mature or
                sexual themes are best avoided in their entirity, as well as work that could be considered offensive
                towards marginalized groups of people(s). If you have a concern regarding something you have in mind,
                please ask me first.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>PAYMENT</h4>
            <p>- The only type of currency I accept is USD via <b>PayPal</b>. Other forms of payment will not be
                accepted unless specifically advertised for. </p>
            <p>- Invoices must be paid within 3 days of being sent or else your slot will be forfeit; exceptions given
                if we have agreed upon a pay date.</p>
            <p>- <b>A commission must be paid in full before I complete it.</b></p>
            <p>- If the commission's total cost surpasses <b>$150 USD</b>, you can contact me to discuss a payment plan,
                but
                until the full payment is received I will not work further than sketches or roughs.</p>
            <p>- Highly detailed pieces (those with wings, mechanical parts, complicated markings or other aspects) are
                subject to additional costs than those advertised, to be quoted on a case-by-case basis.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>REFUNDS/CANCELLATIONS</h4>
            <p>- Commissions may take up to <b>6 months</b> to be completed. If there are delays or other factors
                impeding my ability to work on your commission, I will try to make you aware ASAP via the contact you
                provided me for
                your commission and possibly through public announcements on my dA, Twitter, or Instagram.</p>
            <p>- If you want your piece completed by a certain deadline, rush fees are available and will vary depending
                on how large your commission is and by how soon you want it completed. Reasonable deadlines will be
                exempt
                from rush fees, so please discuss with me prior! I will usually state when I intend for a commission to
                be
                done by when I advertise having open slots.</p>
            <p>- <b>To be valid for a full refund, you must cancel your order before your piece has been started.</b> If
                you've received preliminary sketches or any type of progress shot then you will receive half of what was
                initially paid. In addition, the first payment of any payment plan is nonrefundable.</p>
            <p>- My price sheet is subject to change, meaning prices may be raised or lowered and options may be added
                or removed. This will incur no extra fees to you once your commission has been taken, but also means you
                will not be refunded the difference if my prices lower. </p>
            <p>- I reserve the right to cancel a commission due to delayed payments or complications with proper
                communication. This is extremely rare, and I will make several attempts to contact/work with a
                commissioner before I cancel a commission for one of these reasons.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>COPYRIGHT</h4>
            <p>- You may not claim any of my artwork as your creation, <b>as the artist I retain all rights to my work,
                    whether commission work or personal</b>. You may print posters or stickers of art you've
                commissioned, but you cannot sell merchandise with the artwork for a profit. If you're looking to use my
                art commercially, please contact me.</p>
            <p>- <b>My art is not to, under ANY circumstances, be used for NFTs. Do not commission me if you plan on
                    turning the image into an NFT.</b></p>
            <p>- If you do not want me to publish a commissioned piece, whether at all or for a certain length of time,
                please let me know beforehand. Otherwise once I've sent you your final piece, I will likely post it to
                my social media and add it to my portfolio.</p>
            <p>- <b>You may not repost any of my work</b>. The only exception to this rule is for the usage of my art
                for icons or banners, but you may only do so if you credit back to me! If we have discussed either
                commercial rights or have come to some other agreement, you may be exempt from this term, but only if we
                have come to an agreement.</p>
